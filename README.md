# SpaceCamp
a game made in [engo](https://engoengine.github.io) for the
[Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020)!

# Can you make it to the moon?

You work for a big, important space-age space exploration company, OriginX!
Build your team of brave space explorers, gather supplies, and lead your team
on an out of this world adventure on your company's flagship manned mission to
Mars! Can you survive the perilous journey?

# How to play!

Use WASD to move around and j, k, l, and ; to interact/select/etc.

Press F4 on the opening screen to enable full screen, and hold escape for three
seconds at any time to leave the game.

### Notes

All the assets are open and freely available (most of them are made by me!),
but due to binary size I don't want to include the raw assets in the repo. If
you need a copy to build this, feel free to email me and I can get them for you!
