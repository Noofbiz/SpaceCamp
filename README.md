# CHARACTERS!

Here's a list of the Characters and their stuffs!

## Mechanic

![Mechanic](./images/Mechanic.png)

ATK : 5
DEF : 5
SPD : 5

The mechanic is a pretty decent all-around character. He gets bonuses to fixing
things around the ship, making repairs, and restocking oxygen.

## Xeno Biologist

ATK : 1
DEF : 3
SPD : 5

The Xenobiologist isn't the best combatant, and has some trouble getting chores
done around the ship. However, if you encounter an alien you definitely want
one on your crew!

## Chef

ATK : 6
DEF : 6
SPD : 3

The Chef really knows how to fill bellies. Use less food stores, and your crew
will be happier! A Chef is really a must-have for any crew!

## Security

ATK : 8
DEF : 8
SPD : 5

Security is definitely an important part of the mission. Anything can happen
out there, and having someone around who knows how to fight is always useful.

## Medic

ATK : 3
DEF : 6
SPD : 6

If anyone gets injured, you'll definitely wish you'd brought a medic! Not only
will a first-aid kit last longer, but medics can heal faster to boot!

## Pilot

ATK : 5
DEF : 4
SPD : 5

If communications, navigation, or auto-pilot goes down, the Pilot will help
you get to your destination fastest!

### Notes

All the assets are open and freely available (most of them are made by me!),
but due to binary size I don't want to include the raw assets in the repo. If
you need a copy to build this, feel free to email me and I can get them for you!
